## Project Euler

These are my solutions to the [Project Euler](projecteuler.net) challenges. The different solutions are worked out in the repsective language's folder, and are all run or timed from their `main.\*` scripts. The Explanations on different reasonings behind how the problems are solved can be found in the Explanations folder.

### Benchmarks

*Note: These solutions may use different techniques and should not be used to compare the speed of the languages*

The benchmarks will run each solution 10 times, based on the speed of these 10 times it will run the solution continuously for one minute, or 9,990 more times, whichever one will complete first. With these timings it will then calculate the mean and standard deviation of how long the solution takes to run.
